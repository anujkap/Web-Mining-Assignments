1. Write a program to tokenize
    * A sentence
    * Multiple sentences
2. Write a program to count the frequency of tokenized words from two sentences.
3. Write a program (using nltk toolkit in python environment) to tokenize
    * Sentence
    * Multiple sentences
    * A paragraph
    * Information of a complete web page
4. Write a program to remove the stop words stemming using nltk tool?
